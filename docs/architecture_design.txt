- Person microservice:
  is a RESTFul API service responsible for keeping customer information.
- Connection microservice:
  gets data from Person microservice through RESTFul API.
  Here ,we separate Location service into location event producer microservice and location consumer microservice.  
- location event producer microservice:
  produces user location sent from mobiles devices. By using gRPC
  which will be efficient and match the requirement of processing a lot of users data concurrently.
- Kafka cluster:
  receives this location data which will be consumed by location consumer microservice.

and this data will be stored in postgres database. Location event producer microservice is the service that interacts through a RESTFul API with the React Frontend.
